# Filippin-mockup
A website mockup for a friend of mine. Plain html and CSS

This was my very first project and by writing the code for it I learned a little bit more about flexbox, how to center things and display them in a better way, how to thing about the page itself and how things should be divided in order to get the final result that I had in mind.

Most importantly I wanted to create something fancy looking and create something that wouldn't look like plain HTML. I think that I was able to accompish that.

This "home" will be more thatn likely re-edited afterwards, as I want to create a full working website for the aforementioned friend.
